# UnionSquareDonuts.SQL
This project made for CS50-SQL course.

## General Information
- Made with SQLite.
- Main purpose of the project is self-development in SQL and databases.
- Around Boston, Brookline, and Somerville, you might catch sight of Union Square Donuts, a shop famous in the area for its delicious confections. Suppose that Union Square Donuts has been around for a while and, while their paper receipts have worked well so far, they’re hoping for a system to help them handle more customers. In fact, they’ve just hired you to design a database fitting for their shop. In exchange, free donuts?
- Task at hand is to create a SQLite database for Union Square Donuts from scratch.
