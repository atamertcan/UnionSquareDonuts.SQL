-- Ingredients
-- We certainly need to keep track of our ingredients.
-- Some of the typical ingredients we use include flour, yeast, oil, butter, and several different types of sugar.
-- Moreover, we would love to keep track of the price we pay per unit of ingredient (whether it’s pounds, grams, etc.).

    "id" INTEGER,
    "name" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "price_per_unit" REAL NOT NULL,

);

-- Donuts
-- We’ll need to include our selection of donuts, past and present!
-- For each donut on the menu, we’d love to include three things:
--     * The name of the donut
--     * Whether the donut is gluten-free
--     * The price per donut
-- Oh, and it’s important that we be able to look up the ingredients for each of the donuts!
